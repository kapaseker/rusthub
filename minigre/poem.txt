The woman was naked from the waist down, 
her pants and underwear tossed into the weeds. 
Her down jacket was pulled to her chest, exposing her left breast to the autumn chill. 
Her head and face had been pummeled, 
and embedded in the blows were pellets from a BB gun; 
smashed shards of the gun were found nearby in the brush. 
Her hair was so gummed with blood that the hunter who stumbled on her body couldn’t tell that it had once been all white.
By nightfall on November 29, 
1988, the whole upstate village of Hilton was talking about Viola Manville—74 years old and a grandmother, 
a free spirit, 
outspoken, 
and now a homicide victim. 
Hilton is a small, 
blue-collar farm town on the edge of Lake Ontario west of Rochester where a good number of people once worked on the assembly lines at Kodak. 
The town can be rough—one neighbor from a wealthier suburb calls it “a little Appalachia here in New York”—but Hilton had never seen a murder like this. 
The Monroe County Sheriff’s Office interviewed dozens of people: neighbors, family members, an ex-boyfriend, troubled teenagers. 
They learned that Manville often had been seen walking along the same set of abandoned railroad tracks where her body was found, 
even after having been the victim of an attempted rape there three years earlier. 
The man arrested in that attack, 
Glen Sterling, was still in prison.
